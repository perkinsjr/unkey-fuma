## v1.liveness

| Status code | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `200` | The configured services and their status |
| `400` | The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing). |
| `401` | Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorized", semantically this response means "unauthenticated". That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response. |
| `403` | The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike 401 Unauthorized, the client's identity is known to the server. |
| `404` | The server cannot find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. Servers may also send this response instead of 403 Forbidden to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This response code is probably the most well known due to its frequent occurrence on the web. |
| `409` | This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server. |
| `429` | The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting") |
| `500` | The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle. |

</API>

<API>

<APIInfo method={"POST"} route={"/v1/keys.createKey"}>

## createKey

### Request Body



<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"apiId"} type={"string"}>

Choose an `API` where this key should be created.

<span>Example:  `"api_123"`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"prefix"} type={"string"}>

To make it easier for your users to understand which product an api key belongs to, you can add prefix them.

For example Stripe famously prefixes their customer ids with cus_ or their api keys with sk_live_.

The underscore is automatically added if you are defining a prefix, for example: "prefix": "abc" will result in a key like abc_xxxxxxxxx


<span>Maximum length:  `16`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"name"} type={"string"}>

The name for your Key. This is not customer facing.

<span>Example:  `"my key"`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"byteLength"} type={"integer"}>

The byte length used to generate your key determines its entropy as well as its length. Higher is better, but keys become longer and more annoying to handle. The default is 16 bytes, or 2^^128 possible combinations.

<span>Default:  `16`</span>

<span>Minimum:  `16`</span>

<span>Maximum:  `255`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"ownerId"} type={"string"}>

Your user’s Id. This will provide a link between Unkey and your customer record.
When validating a key, we will return this back to you, so you can clearly identify your user from their api key.

<span>Example:  `"team_123"`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"meta"} type={"object"}>

This is a place for dynamic meta data, anything that feels useful for you should go here

<span>Example:  `{"billingTier":"PRO","trialEnds":"2023-06-16T17:16:37.161Z"}`</span>

<Accordions>

<Accordion title={"Object Type"}>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"[key: string]"} type={"null"}>



</Property>

</Accordion>

</Accordions>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"roles"} type={"array of string"}>

A list of roles that this key should have. If the role does not exist, an error is thrown

<span>Example:  `["admin","finance"]`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"permissions"} type={"array of string"}>

A list of permissions that this key should have. If the permission does not exist, an error is thrown

<span>Example:  `["domains.create_record","say_hello"]`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"expires"} type={"integer"}>

You can auto expire keys by providing a unix timestamp in milliseconds. Once Keys expire they will automatically be disabled and are no longer valid unless you enable them again.

<span>Example:  `1623869797161`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"remaining"} type={"integer"}>

You can limit the number of requests a key can make. Once a key reaches 0 remaining requests, it will automatically be disabled and is no longer valid unless you update it.

<span>Example:  `1000`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"refill"} type={"object"}>

Unkey enables you to refill verifications for each key at regular intervals.

<span>Example:  `{"interval":"daily","amount":100}`</span>

<Accordions>

<Accordion title={"Object Type"}>

<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"interval"} type={"string"}>

Unkey will automatically refill verifications at the set interval.

<span>Value in:  `"daily" | "monthly"`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"amount"} type={"integer"}>

The number of verifications to refill for each occurrence is determined individually for each key.

<span>Minimum:  `0`</span>

</Property>

</Accordion>

</Accordions>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"ratelimit"} type={"object"}>

Unkey comes with per-key fixed-window ratelimiting out of the box.

<span>Example:  `{"type":"fast","limit":10,"duration":60000}`</span>

<Accordions>

<Accordion title={"Object Type"}>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"async"} type={"boolean"}>

Async will return a response immediately, lowering latency at the cost of accuracy. Will be required soon.

<span>Default:  `true`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={true} name={"type"} type={"string"}>

Deprecated, used `async`. Fast ratelimiting doesn't add latency, while consistent ratelimiting is more accurate.

<span>Default:  `"fast"`</span>

<span>Value in:  `"fast" | "consistent"`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"limit"} type={"integer"}>

The total amount of requests in a given interval.

<span>Minimum:  `1`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"duration"} type={"integer"}>

The window duration in milliseconds. Will be required soon.

<span>Example:  `60000`</span>

<span>Minimum:  `1000`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={true} name={"refillRate"} type={"integer"}>

How many tokens to refill during each refillInterval.

<span>Minimum:  `1`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={true} name={"refillInterval"} type={"integer"}>

The refill timeframe, in milliseconds.

<span>Minimum:  `1`</span>

</Property>

</Accordion>

</Accordions>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"enabled"} type={"boolean"}>

Sets if key is enabled or disabled. Disabled keys are not valid.

<span>Example:  `false`</span>

<span>Default:  `true`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"environment"} type={"string"}>

Environments allow you to divide your keyspace.

Some applications like Stripe, Clerk, WorkOS and others have a concept of "live" and "test" keys to
give the developer a way to develop their own application without the risk of modifying real world
resources.

When you set an environment, we will return it back to you when validating the key, so you can
handle it correctly.

| `200` | The configuration for an api |
| `400` | The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing). |
| `401` | Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorized", semantically this response means "unauthenticated". That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response. |
| `403` | The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike 401 Unauthorized, the client's identity is known to the server. |
| `404` | The server cannot find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. Servers may also send this response instead of 403 Forbidden to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This response code is probably the most well known due to its frequent occurrence on the web. |
| `409` | This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server. |
| `429` | The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting") |
| `500` | The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle. |

<span>Value in:  `"daily" | "monthly"`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"amount"} type={"integer"}>

The amount of verifications to refill for each occurrence is determined individually for each key.

<span>Minimum:  `1`</span>

</Property>

</Accordion>

</Accordions>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"enabled"} type={"boolean"}>

Set if key is enabled or disabled. If disabled, the key cannot be used to verify.

<span>Example:  `true`</span>

| Status code | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `200` | The key was successfully updated, it may take up to 30s for this to take effect in all regions |
| `400` | The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing). |
| `401` | Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorized", semantically this response means "unauthenticated". That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response. |
| `403` | The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike 401 Unauthorized, the client's identity is known to the server. |
| `404` | The server cannot find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. Servers may also send this response instead of 403 Forbidden to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This response code is probably the most well known due to its frequent occurrence on the web. |
| `409` | This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server. |
| `429` | The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting") |
| `500` | The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle. |

| `400` | The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing). |
| `401` | Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorized", semantically this response means "unauthenticated". That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response. |
| `403` | The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike 401 Unauthorized, the client's identity is known to the server. |
| `404` | The server cannot find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. Servers may also send this response instead of 403 Forbidden to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This response code is probably the most well known due to its frequent occurrence on the web. |
| `409` | This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server. |
| `429` | The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting") |
| `500` | The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle. |

## createApi

### Request Body



<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"name"} type={"string"}>

The name for your API. This is not customer facing.

<span>Example:  `"my-api"`</span>

<span>Minimum length:  `3`</span>

</Property>

| Status code | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `200` | The configuration for an api |
| `400` | The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing). |
| `401` | Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorized", semantically this response means "unauthenticated". That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response. |
| `403` | The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike 401 Unauthorized, the client's identity is known to the server. |
| `404` | The server cannot find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. Servers may also send this response instead of 403 Forbidden to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This response code is probably the most well known due to its frequent occurrence on the web. |
| `409` | This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server. |
| `429` | The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting") |
| `500` | The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle. |

The id of the api to delete

| ----------- | ----------- |
| `200` | The api was successfully deleted, it may take up to 30s for this to take effect in all regions |
| `400` | The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing). |

| `404` | The server cannot find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. Servers may also send this response instead of 403 Forbidden to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This response code is probably the most well known due to its frequent occurrence on the web. |

| `429` | The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting") |
| `500` | The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle. |

</Property>

| Status code | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `200` | The key ids of all created keys |
| `400` | The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing). |
| `401` | Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorized", semantically this response means "unauthenticated". That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response. |
| `403` | The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike 401 Unauthorized, the client's identity is known to the server. |
| `404` | The server cannot find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. Servers may also send this response instead of 403 Forbidden to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This response code is probably the most well known due to its frequent occurrence on the web. |
| `409` | This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server. |
| `429` | The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting") |

<APIInfo method={"POST"} route={"/v1/migrations.enqueueKeys"}>

## v1.migrations.enqueueKeys

### Request Body



<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"migrationId"} type={"string"}>

Contact support@unkey.dev to receive your migration id.

</Property>

<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"apiId"} type={"string"}>

The id of the api, you want to migrate keys to

</Property>

<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"keys"} type={"array of object"}>



<Accordions>

<Accordion title={"Object Type"}>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"prefix"} type={"string"}>

To make it easier for your users to understand which product an api key belongs to, you can add prefix them.

For example Stripe famously prefixes their customer ids with cus_ or their api keys with sk_live_.

The underscore is automatically added if you are defining a prefix, for example: "prefix": "abc" will result in a key like abc_xxxxxxxxx


<span>Maximum length:  `8`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"name"} type={"string"}>

The name for your Key. This is not customer facing.

<span>Example:  `"my key"`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"plaintext"} type={"string"}>

The raw key in plaintext. If provided, unkey encrypts this value and stores it securely. Provide either `hash` or `plaintext`

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"hash"} type={"object"}>

Provide either `hash` or `plaintext`

<Accordions>

<Accordion title={"Object Type"}>

<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"value"} type={"string"}>

The hashed and encoded key

</Property>

<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"variant"} type={"string"}>

The algorithm for hashing and encoding, currently only sha256 and base64 are supported

<span>Value in:  `"sha256_base64"`</span>

</Property>

</Accordion>

</Accordions>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"start"} type={"string"}>

The first 4 characters of the key. If a prefix is used, it should be the prefix plus 4 characters.

<span>Example:  `"unkey_32kq"`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"ownerId"} type={"string"}>

Your user’s Id. This will provide a link between Unkey and your customer record.
When validating a key, we will return this back to you, so you can clearly identify your user from their api key.

<span>Example:  `"team_123"`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"meta"} type={"object"}>

This is a place for dynamic meta data, anything that feels useful for you should go here

<span>Example:  `{"billingTier":"PRO","trialEnds":"2023-06-16T17:16:37.161Z"}`</span>

<Accordions>

<Accordion title={"Object Type"}>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"[key: string]"} type={"null"}>



</Property>

</Accordion>

</Accordions>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"roles"} type={"array of string"}>

A list of roles that this key should have. If the role does not exist, an error is thrown

<span>Example:  `["admin","finance"]`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"permissions"} type={"array of string"}>

A list of permissions that this key should have. If the permission does not exist, an error is thrown

<span>Example:  `["domains.create_record","say_hello"]`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"expires"} type={"integer"}>

You can auto expire keys by providing a unix timestamp in milliseconds. Once Keys expire they will automatically be disabled and are no longer valid unless you enable them again.

<span>Example:  `1623869797161`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"remaining"} type={"integer"}>

You can limit the number of requests a key can make. Once a key reaches 0 remaining requests, it will automatically be disabled and is no longer valid unless you update it.

<span>Example:  `1000`</span>

<span>Minimum:  `1`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"refill"} type={"object"}>

Unkey enables you to refill verifications for each key at regular intervals.

<span>Example:  `{"interval":"daily","amount":100}`</span>

<Accordions>

<Accordion title={"Object Type"}>

<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"interval"} type={"string"}>

Unkey will automatically refill verifications at the set interval.

<span>Value in:  `"daily" | "monthly"`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"amount"} type={"integer"}>

The number of verifications to refill for each occurrence is determined individually for each key.

<Accordions>

<Accordion title={"Object Type"}>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"async"} type={"boolean"}>

Async will return a response immediately, lowering latency at the cost of accuracy.

<span>Default:  `true`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={true} name={"type"} type={"string"}>

Deprecated, use `async`. Fast ratelimiting doesn't add latency, while consistent ratelimiting is more accurate.

<span>Default:  `"fast"`</span>

<span>Value in:  `"fast" | "consistent"`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"limit"} type={"integer"}>

The total amount of requests in a given interval.

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"environment"} type={"string"}>

Environments allow you to divide your keyspace.

Some applications like Stripe, Clerk, WorkOS and others have a concept of "live" and "test" keys to
give the developer a way to develop their own application without the risk of modifying real world
resources.

When you set an environment, we will return it back to you when validating the key, so you can
handle it correctly.

In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist.

## deprecated.createKey

### Request Body



<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"apiId"} type={"string"}>

Choose an `API` where this key should be created.

<span>Example:  `"api_123"`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"prefix"} type={"string"}>

To make it easier for your users to understand which product an api key belongs to, you can add prefix them.

For example Stripe famously prefixes their customer ids with cus_ or their api keys with sk_live_.

The underscore is automatically added if you are defining a prefix, for example: "prefix": "abc" will result in a key like abc_xxxxxxxxx


<span>Maximum length:  `8`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"name"} type={"string"}>

The name for your Key. This is not customer facing.

<span>Example:  `"my key"`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"byteLength"} type={"integer"}>

The byte length used to generate your key determines its entropy as well as its length. Higher is better, but keys become longer and more annoying to handle. The default is 16 bytes, or 2^^128 possible combinations.

<span>Default:  `16`</span>

<span>Minimum:  `16`</span>

<span>Maximum:  `255`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"ownerId"} type={"string"}>

Your user’s Id. This will provide a link between Unkey and your customer record.
When validating a key, we will return this back to you, so you can clearly identify your user from their api key.

<span>Example:  `"team_123"`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"meta"} type={"object"}>

This is a place for dynamic meta data, anything that feels useful for you should go here

<span>Example:  `{"billingTier":"PRO","trialEnds":"2023-06-16T17:16:37.161Z"}`</span>

<Accordions>

<Accordion title={"Object Type"}>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"[key: string]"} type={"null"}>



</Property>

</Accordion>

</Accordions>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"expires"} type={"integer"}>

You can auto expire keys by providing a unix timestamp in milliseconds. Once Keys expire they will automatically be disabled and are no longer valid unless you enable them again.

<span>Example:  `1623869797161`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"remaining"} type={"integer"}>

You can limit the number of requests a key can make. Once a key reaches 0 remaining requests, it will automatically be disabled and is no longer valid unless you update it.

<span>Example:  `1000`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"ratelimit"} type={"object"}>

Unkey comes with per-key ratelimiting out of the box.

<span>Example:  `{"type":"fast","limit":10,"refillRate":1,"refillInterval":60}`</span>

<Accordions>

<Accordion title={"Object Type"}>

<Property required={false} deprecated={false} name={"type"} type={"string"}>

Fast ratelimiting doesn't add latency, while consistent ratelimiting is more accurate.

<span>Default:  `"fast"`</span>

<span>Value in:  `"fast" | "consistent"`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"limit"} type={"integer"}>

The total amount of burstable requests.

<span>Minimum:  `1`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"refillRate"} type={"integer"}>

How many tokens to refill during each refillInterval.

<span>Minimum:  `1`</span>

</Property>

<Property required={true} deprecated={false} name={"refillInterval"} type={"integer"}>

Determines the speed at which tokens are refilled, in milliseconds.

<span>Minimum:  `1`</span>

| Status code | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `200` | The verification result |
| `400` | The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing). |
| `401` | Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorized", semantically this response means "unauthenticated". That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response. |
| `403` | The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike 401 Unauthorized, the client's identity is known to the server. |
| `404` | The server cannot find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. Servers may also send this response instead of 403 Forbidden to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This response code is probably the most well known due to its frequent occurrence on the web. |
| `409` | This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server. |
| `429` | The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting") |
| `500` | The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle. |
