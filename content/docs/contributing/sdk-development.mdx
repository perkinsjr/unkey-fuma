# Telemetry

Unkey collects anonymous telemetry data to help us understand usage of the framework. If you're authoring an SDK, you should record usage information and send it via `Upstash-Telemetry` headers.

### Typescript libraries

The Unkey Typescript library `@unkey/api` is already set up to collect telemetry data. If you're writing a new SDK for a framework that makes use of that library
under the hood, you just need to enable the user to disable telemetry; otherwise, pass it in the constructor. You can see an example of this via the Next.js SDK
[here](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/blob/main/packages/nextjs/src/index.ts#L99).

### Telemetry request headers

Unkey records telemetry data via three headers. You can see an example of how this is used in the Typescript SDK [here](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/blob/main/packages/api/src/client.ts#L138)




```bash Sending Telemetry
curl -XPOST 'https://api.unkey.dev/v1/keys.verifyKey' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Unkey-Telemetry-SDK: @unkey/api@1.10.0" \
  -H "Unkey-Telemetry-Platform: Vercel" \
  -H "Unkey-Telemetry-Runtime: edge-light" \
  -d '{ "key": "<...>" }'
```
